1. What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?

   - readyState shows the current state of the XMLHttpRequest (from 0 to 4):
       0 – Request not initialized
       1 – Server connection established
       2 – Request received
       3 – Processing request
       4 – Request finished and response is ready
   - status shows the HTTP response code (e.g., 200 for OK, 404 for Not Found, 500 for Server Error).

2. How can you make the request asynchronous?

   - By setting the third parameter of xhr.open() to true:
       xhr.open("GET", "url", true);
     This makes the request asynchronous.

3. Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?

   - Asynchronous​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ requests should be the default for web applications since they provide the seamless experience that 
   users expect today. By using async AJAX calls, the user interface remains responsive, which results in a much better 
   experience for the ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌users.
