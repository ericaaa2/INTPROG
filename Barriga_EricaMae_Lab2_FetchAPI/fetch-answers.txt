1. What are the main differences between XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API?
- Fetch API is based on Promises, whereas XMLHttpRequest employs callback functions. 
Fetch is more straightforward and makes JSON handling more direct.

2. Why is the Fetch API considered more modern and readable?
- The main reason for that is it is based on Promises, has a cleaner syntax, and is compatible 
with async/await for response handling.

3. What is the purpose of the .then() and .catch() methods in Fetch?
- .then() is used to process the successful responses, while .catch() is for handling errors 
such as a bad network connection.

4. What happens when you send a POST request to the placeholder API?
-  Basically, it is a simulation of creating a new post and as a way of confirmation, 
it returns a fabricated ID (for example, 101), but the data is not really ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌saved.
